                <dt>Toronto Metropolitan University / TMU / 2020 - 2025</dt>
                <dd>Currently a 4th year student at Toronto Metropolitan University, enrolled in the Budsiness Technology Management program (BTM).<br>Although my degree is a bachelors of commerce, my education is mostly IT based. Meaning the majority of my education is made up of <br>courses such as big data analytics, cloud computing, programming, systems analysis and design, enterprise architecture, and more! And <br> ofcourse there is also a healthy mix of business courses such as managerial finance, accounting, economics, global management, and more!<br><br>One course I found really useful was business law. It gave me a deeper understanding of how businesses operate on the logistics and legal end of things. <br>Not only that, it was the course that I not only enjoyed the most by far, but also achieved the highest grade for.</dd>

                <dd>SLSS was the true beginning of my academic career. In my highschool years I grew as a person and as a student, developing the skills that would allow <br> me to be successful throughout my personal, professional, and academic life/careers. </dd>

                <dt>Peer Tutor - Self Employed</dt>
                <dd>During my second year at TMU, I noticed my fellow students severely struggling to grasp concepts and complete assignments for my intro to programming class. Since I had prior<br> knowledge with the programming language being taught, I offered my help to a friend. A student overheard and asked to join in on the make-shift tutoring session and soon the word<br> spread aroud. I ended up creating an online learning environment using Discord where I would hold weekly tutoring sessions for not only my class and professor, but also another professors class.<br> I would record and upload these tutoring sessions to a Google drive for those who were not able to make it to the live sessions. In these tutoring sessions I would go over concepts learned in class<br> and go through example problems.</dd>
